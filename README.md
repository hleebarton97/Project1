# TAMUCC FALL 2017 - COSC-3324-001: Object-Oriented Programming
# Project One

This group project required an object oriented console version of an e-commerce website.
We used the Database as text files.
The user had to be able to add items to their cart, checkout, and receive a receipt.
The user had to be able to upgrade their membership.
The database must be updated to reflect purchases and if items are in-stock.
